# 🛒 Online Retail Sales Database Project

## 📖 Introduction
The **Online Retail Sales Database** project is a structured database management system designed for an **e-commerce platform**.  
It helps manage and track operations related to **Products, Customers, Orders, Payments, Inventory, and Suppliers** efficiently.  
The project demonstrates **database normalization (up to 3NF)**, **referential integrity**, and **report generation** using SQL queries.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design, implement, and test a normalized SQL database that can handle the operations of an online retail business, including:
- Managing product catalog and stock
- Processing customer orders and payments
- Tracking deliveries and suppliers
- Generating sales and financial reports

## 🧰 Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Microsoft SQL Server** | Database creation, execution, and testing |
| **dbdiagram.io** | Designing and visualizing the ER diagram |
| **Visual Studio Code / SSMS** | SQL editing and debugging |

---

## 🏗️ Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Identified entities and their relationships.  
2. **ER Diagram Design** – Created using `dbdiagram.io`.  
3. **Schema Definition (DDL)** – Created 29 tables with keys and constraints.  
4. **Sample Data (DML)** – Inserted related data ensuring referential integrity.  
5. **Query Development** – Built `JOIN`, `VIEW`, and `AGGREGATE` queries for analysis.  
6. **Testing & Validation** – Verified query results and business logic.  
7. **Report Generation** – Created a 2-page professional project report in PDF.
